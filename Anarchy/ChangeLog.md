## Patch V1.5.0
* Set relative Elevation with Object tool and line tool for props, trees, and plants. (Options to disable and automatically reset elevation) keybinds: up arrow -> elevation up, down arrow -> elevation down, shift + r -> reset elevation to 0, shift + e -> change elevation step.
* Elevation lock to prevent game systems from changing position of props, trees, plants, and decals. You can still change position with mods.
* Fixed Stuttering from Prevent Accidental Culling system with heavily detailed builds or those with Anarchy forests.
* Anarchy and Elevation lock can be added or removed after placement via the selected info panel. (Thanks Dome for the idea)
* Ctrl + A keyboard shortcut can toggle anarchy at any time. You will only be able to tell using flaming chirper.
* Updated localization.
* Support for EDT such as: 
	* Anarchy enabled allows placement of NetLane Fences and Hedges close together and overlapping.
	* Automatically adds Elevation Lock when using Snap to Object Surface snapping option.
