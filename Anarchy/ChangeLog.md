## Patch V1.7.3
This is not a fix. It's a rollback of features. 

The following features/fixes have been removed to try and prevent new save file issues from arising:
* All Network Anarchy Tool Options
* Entire Network Upgrade Overhaul
* All Network Upgrade Assets from Extended Road Upgrades
* Fixes to Extended Road Upgrades including retaining wall node issue and fire and rescue info view issue
* Elevation Step Slider

Options related to these features have been hidden.

The rollback should prevent new issues from arising but previous exposure to v1.7.0 - v1.7.2 could still cause problems even after changing versions.

I hope to develop a permanent fix and re-publish these features. 

That will take time, research, development, and testing.
