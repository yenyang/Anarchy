This mod allows you to place vegetation and props (with DevUI 'Add Object' menu) overlapping or inside the boundaries of other objects and close together. The mod also has: Optional Tool icon, Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+A), Optional flaming chirper, Option to automatically enable with bulldozer, Optional mouse tooltip, Opt-In Option to allow multiple copies of unique buildings using toolbar menu. Effects of multiple buildings stack!, Option to set minimum clearance below elevated networks even while Anarchy is active in case you don't remove the zoning under a low bridge.
